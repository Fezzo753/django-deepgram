## Quickstart

### Manual

Follow these steps to get started with this starter application.

#### Clone the repository

Go to GitHub and [clone the repository](https://github.com/deepgram-starters/prerecorded-django-starter).

#### Install dependencies

Install the project dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Edit the config file

Copy the code from `sample.env` and create a new file called `.env`. **Replace `%api_key%` with your actual API key** you generated in the [Deepgram console](https://console.deepgram.com/).

```bash
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Make sure to replace `%api_key%` with your real Deepgram API key, not the placeholder text!

#### Run the application

Once running, you can [access the application in your browser](http://localhost:8080/).

```bash
python ./app.py runserver localhost:8080
```

## Setting up a Python developer environment

Install `virtualenv`.

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

Create a virtual environment.

```bash
python -m venv env
```

Activate the environment.

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

Then install your dependencies with pip and they will be installed in the virtual environment rather than your user.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
